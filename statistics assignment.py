#1. What is a random variable in probability theory?

#ans.>> A set of possible value from a random experiment .t maps outcomes of a probability space to real numbers.

#2. What are the types of random variables?

#ans.>> there are two types of random variable :
#      1. discrete random variable : it takes count values (0,1,2 etc)
#      2.continuous random varibale : it takes any value with in range...

#3. Difference between discrete and continuous distributions:

#ans.>> 1. discrete random variable : it takes count values (0,1,2 etc)
#      2.continuous random varibale : it takes any value with in range

#4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?

#ans.>> continuous variable, it takes any value with in a particular range not exact value ,it is called probability distribution functions (PDF)..

#5. Difference between CDF and PDF:

#ans.>> 1.probability distribution functions (PDF) belonges to continuous variable, it takes any value with in a particular range not exact value.
#      2. cummulative distribution function (CDF),Gives the probability that the variable is less than or equal to a specific value.

#6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?

#ans.>> in a discrete uniform distribution , the outcome are discreate and having some probability like.. tossing a coin , rolling a dice..

#7. Key properties of a Bernoulli distribution:

#ans.>> these are properties of bernoulli distribution :
#      1.number of trail should be finite
#      2.each trail should be independent
#      3.there are 2 possible outcome(pass,fail)
#      4.possiblity of each outcome in each trail should be same..

#8. What is the binomial distribution and its use?

#ans.>> binomial distribution is the 'n' bernoulli distribution (where 'n' is n no. of success)

#9. What is the Poisson distribution and its applications?

#ans.>>the poission distribution is discrete prob. distribution that describe the no. of event that ouccer within a fixed interval of time or space given a known average rate of occure
#      it was denoted by lambda(λ)
#      Example: number of calls at a call center per hour....

#10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?

#ans.>> it is a distribution that has infinite no. of values define in a specified range,All values in a given interval have equal probability density
#       example : a perfect random no. generator like OTP generator....

#11. Characteristics of a normal distribution:

#ans.>> these are the characterstics of normal distribution :
#      1. bell shaped distribution
#      2.symmertrical about mean
#      3.mean = median = mode
#      4. skewness = 0

#12. What is the standard normal distribution and why is it important?

#ans.>> standard normal distribution is continuous probability distribution , a special case of normal distribution μ=0,σ=1.
#      standardized the data and comparing those standardized set of data using Zscore...

#13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?

#ans.>> CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, 
#       as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution...

#14. How does CLT relate to the normal distribution?

#ans.>>Thanks to CLT, we can use the normal distribution to approximate the behavior of the sample mean for large samples...

#15. Application of Z-statistics in hypothesis testing:

#ans.>>Z-statistics measure how far a sample mean is from the population mean in units of standard deviation. 
#      Used to test hypotheses about population means.

#16. How to calculate a Z-score and what it represents:

#ans.>> zscore = (x - mean)/standard deviation , it represents x is how many standard deviation far from mean........

#17. Point estimates and interval estimates:

#ans.>> 1.Point estimates : a point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the true value of a population parameter
#       2.interval estimates: range of value used to estimate the unknown population parameter,range is used to avoiding uncertainity...


#18. Significance of confidence intervals:

#ans.>>interval estimates: range of value used to estimate the unknown population parameter which is lies b/w the such range,
#      range is used to avoiding uncertainity , it will incerase the level of confidence...


#19. Relationship between Z-score and confidence interval:

#ans.>> confidence interval gives a range value with in which mean of population fall , which gives more confidence ......


20.# How Z-scores compare different distributions:

#ans.>> it used to standardize values,which make it possible to compare different distributions or units of two data sets....


#21. Assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem:

#ans.>> 1. the no. of sample should be large
#       2. the sample size should be greater than  or equal to 30(except the population distribution which is already a normal distribution)

#22. Concept of expected value in a probability distribution:

#ans.>> E(x) =sum(x.p(x))

#23. How probability distribution relates to expected outcome:

#ans.>>The expected value is a weighted average of all possible outcomes, reflecting the long-term average result....
